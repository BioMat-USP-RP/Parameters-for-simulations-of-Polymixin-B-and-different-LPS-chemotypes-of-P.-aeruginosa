# Parameters-for-simulations-of-Polymixin-B-and-different-LPS-chemotypes-of-P.-aeruginosa


This file contains the topologies and coordinates for Polymixin B and different LPS chemotypes of the Gram-negative bacteria P. aeruginosa, namely, Lipid A, Lipid A modified with 4-amino-4-deoxy-L-arabinose (hexa- and pentaacylated species) and LPS Re (pentaacylated species). The membrane coordinates have been equilibrated for 200 ns. These files are expected to be error-free, but please do check them for errors. If you find any issue please drop us an email. If you make use of the topologies and/or atomic coordinates for you research, please cite: Santos, D. E. S. ; Pol-Fachin, L. ; Lins, R. D. ; Soares, T. A.
